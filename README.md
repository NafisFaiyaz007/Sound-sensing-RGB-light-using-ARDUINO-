# Sound-sensing-RGB-light-using-ARDUINO-
Arduino UNO Microcontroller based sound sensing RBG stripe lights. 
In this project we have tried to make a sound sensing RGB music sync light wihich is controlled by a Arduino Uno microcontroller. The main objective of the project Is that it will take analogue sound signals via the microphone of the sound sensor. The signals will be fed into the microcontroller chip. As the sound travels as wave and has certain frequencies, the signals will have varying frequencies, and the color of the RGB strip light will change accordingly. The change in the color of the RGB light is controlled by a set of conditional statement. The micro controller computes the frequency of sound, compares it with the given code and changes the color of light accordingly. Hence we can say that the micro processor is interrupted by the I/O input which is the different range of frequencies. And after computing the input frequency value it changes the color of the light accordingly. This is run in a loop until the varying sound source stops.
